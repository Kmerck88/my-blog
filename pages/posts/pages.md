# Combining Workplace Support Expertise with Full Stack Web Development Skills

Hello, my name is Kevin Merck, and I am a Workplace Support Ambassador at Rocket Central. With over 12 years of experience in workplace-related support and services, I have honed my skills in collaborating with building maintenance, client-oriented projects, and the events team to deliver comprehensive workplace support.

However, I havecompleted a C# .NET Full Stack Bootcamp to expand my software engineering skills and transition into web development. As I transition into software development, I am excited to combine my workplace support expertise with my front-end and back-end web development skills.

My proficiency in creating visually appealing and responsive designs using CSS and developing dynamic front-end functionalities with Angular, as well as experience in database management with MySQL, will allow me to contribute to cutting-edge web applications that deliver seamless user experiences and meet technical requirements.

I am passionate about continuous learning and growth, and I actively seek opportunities to expand my programming knowledge and stay at the forefront of industry trends. By embracing new challenges and collaborating with talented teams, I aim to make meaningful contributions to projects that push the boundaries of what is possible in the digital landscape.

If you are looking for a motivated and versatile professional with expertise in workplace support and web development, I would welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how my skills can contribute to the success of your organization. Let's collaborate to create exceptional web applications that enhance workplace productivity and satisfaction.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
